Thank you for looking at my repo! 

This program written in C++ reads each line of a given "txt" file, stores it inside of a vector<string> type, and chooses the next game the user will play if the game has been picked out five times. It can then print out the results of the algorithm and create a "txt" file based on it.

I came up with this program while deciding what video game to play next. Instead of spinning a wheel online, I decided to use what I knew about Object-Oriented Programming and create a program that decided for me. It took me roughly 2 hours to get its main function written out, and I think it was worth it.

This repo contains the following:
* main.cpp - the main file for the program
* Chooser.hpp - the design of the Chooser object
* Chooser.cpp - the implementation of the Chooser object with comments
* games.txt - a file containing the titles of the games that I, as of me writing this, haven't finished or touched separated by new lines
* Makefile - a makefile that compiles my program
* VGChooser.exe - a demo executable file that chooses a game based on the included "games.txt" file

Let me know what you think! I am open to any and all criticism of this program.
